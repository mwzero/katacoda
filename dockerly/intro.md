Docker is an open platform tool to make it easier to create, deploy and to execute the applications by using containers. 

Containers allow us to separate the applications from the infrastructure so we can deploy application/software faster.

We can manage our infrastructure in the same ways as we manage our applications. The Docker is like a virtual machine but creating a new whole virtual machine; it allows us to use the same Linux kernel.

The advantage of Docker platform is to ship, test, and deploy code quicker so that we can effectively reduce the time between writing code and execute it in production.

And the main important thing about Docker is that it’s open source i.e. anyone can use it and can contribute to docker to make it easier and more features in it which aren’t available in it.

Docker Platform
The advantage of docker is to build the package and run the application in sandbox environment said container.

The docker container system utilizes the operating system virtualization to utilize and combine the components of an application system which support every standard Linux machine.

The isolation and security factors allow us to execute many containers parallel on a given system.

Containers are lightweight in size because they don’t need the extra resource of a HyperV or VMware, but run directly within the machine kernel. We can even run Docker containers within machines that are actually virtual/hyper machines.
